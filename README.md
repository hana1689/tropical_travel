## Introduction
This project is a website dedicated to the city where I grow up, which is Saigon. An idea that centered around bringing foreign people to visit and creating opportunities for them to make friends with local people. The website is launched to do just that. I believe an amazing adventure is marked by a collection of experiences with places and the people that they visit and meet. My mission is to help people discover and collect those treasures. My focus is to introduce people to the best places in town in terms of food, hotels, entertainment, sights, etc and interesting activities and events that they can join in to make friends with others. Given all that information, the audience that I want to focus on is foreign people and people from other cities.
